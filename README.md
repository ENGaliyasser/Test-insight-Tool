# Test Insight Tool

The Test Insight Tool is a Python-based application that automates the extraction of test results from HTML files and consolidates them into an Excel spreadsheet. The tool uses Selenium for web scraping, OpenPyXL for Excel operations, and PyQt5 for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

- Browse and select a folder containing HTML report files.
- Extract test data from HTML files.
- Consolidate test data into an Excel spreadsheet with well-organized columns.
- Automatically adjust column widths based on content.
- Display a summary of the test results in the GUI.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Google Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver (compatible with your version of Chrome)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ENGaliyasser/Test-insight-Tool.git
    cd Test-insight-Tool
    ```

2. **Download ChromeDriver:**

    Download the ChromeDriver from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and place it in a directory included in your system's PATH, or specify the path in the code where needed.

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Using the GUI:**

    - Click the "Browse" button to select the folder containing your HTML report files.
    - Click the "Extract" button to start the extraction process.
    - The results will be saved in an Excel file named `result.xlsx` in the selected folder.
    - A summary of the test results will be displayed in the text browser within the GUI.

## Code Overview

### main.py

This is the main entry point of the application. It initializes the GUI and connects the buttons to their respective functions.

### back.py

This file contains the backend logic for extracting data from HTML files, creating the Excel workbook, and adjusting the column widths. The primary functions include:

- `browse_folder`: Opens a file dialog to select a folder.
- `extract_data`: Main function that handles the extraction process.
- `get_html_files`: Returns a list of HTML files in the selected folder.
- `create_workbook_with_headers`: Creates an Excel workbook and adds headers.
- `append_test_steps`: Appends test steps to the worksheet.
- `extract_overall_result`: Extracts the overall test result from the last row.
- `append_overall_result`: Appends the overall test result to the worksheet.
- `adjust_column_widths`: Adjusts the column widths based on the content.
- `save_workbook`: Saves the workbook to the specified folder.
- `display_summary`: Displays a summary of the results in the text browser.
